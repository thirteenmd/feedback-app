# About this APP

This project is part of my React learning path. The application allows users to add, update and delete feedback. It uses a mock REST api with json-server.

This project goes over all of the fundamentals of React including:
* Components
* JSX
* Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc)
* State (Component & App Level)
* Styling
* Handling Events
* Lists & Keys
* Forms
* Context API
* HTTP Requests
